A drug.
A big green.
It breathed fire burn.
It breathed fire burn houses down.

How will the unfortunate villages
How will the unfortunate villages be saved?
Maybe a soldier.

It was by a beautiful princess.
It was by a beautiful princess. She threw a spear at the drug.
Happiness returned.
Very Christmas.

I said, Wait for me.
I don't know. It still wasn't
I don't know It still wasn't thing awards.
